## Project Overview

Password-protected one-pager website designed as pitch material for Louise Herping Ellegaard, targeting her potential investment/advisory role in MEasAI.

### Context

Louise Herping Ellegaard (Løvens Hule investor, Clio Online founder, ~300M kr exit) responded positively to Christian's LinkedIn message about MEasAI's "Digital AI Coworker" concept. She wrote: *"Jeg har afprøvet lidt forskellige agenter, og jeg synes ikke, jeg endnu har fundet det helt perfekte match. Hvor kan jeg læse mere om din?"*

This website is our response.

## Website Structure

### Part 1: Core Pitch (10 Sections)

1. **Intro/Hook** - Personal welcome, why she's receiving this
2. **The Problem** - Fragmented AI agents, no memory, no collaboration
3. **The Solution** - Digital AI Coworker concept
4. **How It Works** - MEasAI Maestro Orchestra explained simply
5. **Differentiation** - Why better than Manus, Windsurf, Lovable
6. **Traction** - 6 paying users, 15+ months self-funded, Book published

8. **Team** - Christian + Janus, complementary competencies
9. **Vision** - Where MEasAI can go
10. **Ask** - What we're seeking, next steps

### Part 2: Louise-Specific Sections (4 Sections)

11. **MEasAI Academy** - EdTech angle (hits her Clio background)
12. **Bootstrapping Story** - Consciously avoided VC, like she did
13. **Neurodivergent Potential** - AI that remembers/structures (her niche!)
14. **Women in AI** (Optional) - Only if authentic, she sees through tokenism

## Notes

- This is MEasAI's first targeted investor pitch website
- Louise could be our first AI-focused investor
- Her Clio Online exit (~300M kr) proves she understands SaaS scaling
- Her neurodivergent focus (Tiimo, Bubbles) aligns with MEasAI's potential
- She values bootstrapping — we're 15+ months self-funded
- Subscription model (€3.95/month) is her favorite business model

**Opportunity:** Louise has never invested in AI yet. We could be her first.
