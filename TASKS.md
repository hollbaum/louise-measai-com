## Notes

**Key Insight from Source Chat:**
The original conversation included extensive research on Louise's background, investment preferences, and aesthetic style. All of that context is baked into the specs above.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Mobile-first (she likely reads on phone)
2. Subscription business model highlighted (her favorite!)
3. EdTech angle (MEasAI Academy section)
4. Neurodivergent potential (her investment niche)
5. Bootstrapping story (she relates to this)
6. No cookies/tracking explicitly stated (she'll notice!)

**Opportunity:**
Louise has never invested in AI yet. We could be her first AI investment.
