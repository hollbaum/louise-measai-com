# Section 8: Team

**Christian Hollbaum Jakobsen**
IT Specialist & Lead at MSD (Merck Sharp & Dohme), managing 11 direct reports across global IT operations. Christian brings deep technical expertise combined with proven leadership in enterprise environments. His vision: AI not as a tool, but as a genuine collaborative partner.

**Janus (Business Partner)**
Joined MEasAI in August 2025, bringing commercial expertise and strategic thinking. Together with Christian, they form a complementary team—technical depth meets business acumen. Learn more at meetmike.pro.

**What makes this team different?** We're not chasing VC funding to scale fast. We're building sustainably, one user at a time, just like you did with Clio Online.

# Section 9: Vision

MEasAI started with a simple question: What if AI could remember who you are, across every conversation, every device, every platform?

The vision extends beyond personal productivity:
- **MEasAI Academy** (EdTech) — Teaching the next generation to build with AI, not just use it
- **Neurodivergent support** — AI that remembers, structures, and reduces cognitive load
- **Enterprise collaboration** — Teams working with persistent AI partners, not disposable chatbots

But we're not promising the moon. We're 15 months in, 6 paying users, proving the concept one step at a time. The question isn't "Will this scale to millions?" — it's "Does it genuinely help the people using it today?"

The answer is yes. That's why they're still here.

# Section 10: The Ask

**What we're seeking:**

We're not looking for a large capital injection. MEasAI has been self-funded for 15+ months, and we're profitable at our current scale. What we value more than capital right now is:

1. **Strategic guidance** — You've scaled a bootstrapped SaaS company to a 300M kr exit. Your experience navigating growth without losing control is exactly what we need.

2. **Network access** — Your EdTech connections, your Løvens Hule relationships, your understanding of the Danish startup ecosystem.

3. **Sparring partner** — Someone who's been there, who understands the temptation to scale too fast, who values sustainable growth over hype.

If capital becomes part of the conversation, we're thinking 100,000-500,000 kr (your typical range) for advisory + strategic investment. But honestly? Your experience and network might be more valuable than the kroner.

**Next step:** Let's have a conversation. Coffee, video call, whatever works. No pitch deck required—you've already read this far, which means you're intrigued.

# Section 11: MEasAI Academy (EdTech Angle)

This one's for you, Louise.

Remember Clio Online? You built an empire helping students learn. MEasAI Academy is our version of that—but instead of teaching history, we're teaching people to build with AI.

**The concept:**
- Inspired by the Library of Alexandria and the Mouseion (scholar community)
- Thematic rooms: Great Reading Room, Lecture Halls, Scholars' Quarters
- Students learn by building real startups using the Maestro architecture
- Business model: Equity + development labor in exchange for access

**Why this matters:**
- You've proven EdTech can scale profitably (Clio Online: subscription model that worked)
- You understand how to teach complex topics (making history accessible to teenagers)
- You care about the next generation having the tools to compete

MEasAI Academy isn't live yet—it's on the roadmap. But it's core to our vision. We want to be more than a SaaS product. We want to be where the next generation learns to collaborate with AI, not just use it.

Sound familiar? It should. You've already built this once.

# Section 12: The Bootstrapping Story

Here's something you'll appreciate: We said no to VC funding.

Not because we're anti-investor (obviously—we're talking to you!). But because we watched too many startups optimize for the next funding round instead of the next customer. We wanted mission alignment over growth hacking.

**The numbers:**
- 15+ months self-funded (€5,000/month operating costs)
- 6 paying users at €3.95/month (yes, we're tiny)
- No debt, no dilution, no pressure to pivot for investors
- Profitable at current scale (break-even with minimal users)

**Why you'll relate:**
You bootstrapped Clio Online for 12 years before the exit. You took no investors. You built it your way, scaled it sustainably, and sold it on your terms for ~300M kr.

We're doing the same thing. Different industry, different era, but the same philosophy: Build something real, prove it works, scale when it makes sense—not before.

You once said in an interview: "I wanted to keep control." We get it. That's why we're still independent.

# Section 13: Neurodivergent Potential

You've invested in Tiimo (ADHD planning app), Bubbles (neurodivergent communication), and FLOOFERS (sensory-friendly products). There's a pattern here, Louise—and MEasAI fits it perfectly.

**Why MEasAI helps neurodivergent users:**

1. **Memory support** — The AI remembers conversations, tasks, context. For someone with ADHD who forgets what they were working on after a phone call? That's transformative.

2. **Structure without rigidity** — MEasAI provides organization (task lists, reminders, follow-ups) but adapts to how you work, not how a template says you should.

3. **Reduces cognitive load** — Instead of context-switching between 5 different AI tools, one persistent partner handles everything. Less decision fatigue.

4. **Patient and non-judgmental** — AI doesn't get frustrated when you ask the same question three times or need reminders for something "obvious."

We're not marketing MEasAI specifically as a neurodivergent tool (that would be exploitative). But the features we're building—memory, persistence, proactive follow-ups—happen to align perfectly with neurodivergent needs.

This isn't a pivot. It's a natural fit. And you've already proven there's a market here.

# Section 14: Women in AI (If Authentic)

We're aware you've been critical of the lack of women in AI leadership. You're right to be.

MEasAI's team is currently two men (Christian and Janus). We're not going to pretend otherwise or claim false diversity. But here's what we are doing:

**Bettina (Contributor):**
Has been involved in strategy discussions and operational feedback. Not a co-founder, not a full-time role, but a voice in the room.

**Our commitment:**
As we grow, we're intentional about building a diverse team—not for optics, but because diverse perspectives build better products. You've seen this in your own investments (Bubbles founded by women, FLOOFERS founded by a woman).

We're not asking you to overlook the current team composition. We're asking you to help us get it right as we grow.

**Why mention this at all?**
Because you'll notice if we don't. And because we'd rather be honest and accountable than performative. If this disqualifies us, we understand. But we thought transparency was better than silence.
